<p>I am a generalist programmer, working from web development to iOS programming and desktop applications.
I also consider myself to have an eye for interface design and product usability.</p>
<p>On my projects I usually work end-to-end, from the conception to the implementation to the deployment, delivering a complete product.
Well versed on a myriad of technologies and concepts I have worked on some amazing projects over the years and I'm always
looking for a new challenge.</p>
<p>Being fascinated by computers and the internet and by how the internet has changed our life and what can be achieved using it as a medium, I have taught
myself how to program and how to create things since I was a child. Today I try to be an active member of the software community
and I also write a <a href="http://raphaelcruzeiro.com/blog">blog</a> on software development.</p>
<p>When I'm not working nor am I engaged in some weird personal project I try to enjoy life as it is the most precious possession I have.</p>
